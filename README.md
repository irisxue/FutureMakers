# FutureMakers

**Responses**

**Day 1:**
I got introduced to the program and met other students. I learned the basics about python, numpy, and how to set up everything in jupyter notebook/colab and github.

**Day 2:**
I learned that storytelling isn't hard, we just need to find the best way to convey our story. One of my unique contributions is hosting a girs coding competition
for middle and high school students around the world.

**Day 3:**
Supervised Learning: Uses labeled dataset to train algorithms to classify data and predict outcomes. Two types of problems that supervised learning is used for are classification and regression.
Unsupervized Learning: Finds patterns in unlabeled data. Two types of problems that supervised learning is used for are clustering, association and dimensionality reduction.

**Day 4**
A real world problem is the COVID-19 pandemic.

Using these datasets, I would like to predict the effectivity of a vaccine for a certain person given their demographic and health information. I would use supervised learning because I already have a labeled dataset and my goal is to predict the outcome. I would probably use regression.
