**Responses**

**Day 1:**
I got introduced to the program and met other students. I learned the basics about python, numpy, and how to set up everything in jupyter notebook/colab and github.

**Day 2:**
I learned that storytelling isn't hard, we just need to find the best way to convey our story. One of my unique contributions is hosting a girs coding competition
for middle and high school students around the world.

**Day 3:**
Supervised Learning: Uses labeled dataset to train algorithms to classify data and predict outcomes. Two types of problems that supervised learning is used for are classification and regression.
Unsupervized Learning: Finds patterns in unlabeled data. Two types of problems that supervised learning is used for are clustering, association and dimensionality reduction.

**Day 4**
A real world problem is the COVID-19 pandemic.

Using these datasets, I would like to predict the effectivity of a vaccine for a certain person given their demographic and health information. I would use supervised learning because I already have a labeled dataset and my goal is to predict the outcome. I would probably use regression.

**Day 7:**
What are “Tensors” and what are they used for in Machine Learning? 
A tensor is a generalization of vectors and matrices and is understood as a multidimensional array. It’s primarily used for neural networks in ML. For example, a tensor can represent an image with three fields, width, height, and depth (color).
What did you notice about the computations that you ran in the TensorFlow programs (i.e. interactive models) in the tutorial?
I noticed that matplotlib was able to generate some really nice figures describing the data. I also noticed that some of the models took a very long time to run. This is probably because there is a lot of data and computations involved with the models. I like how the tutorial went step by step and had an option to see the solution if we are stuck on it.

**Day 8:**
I used an already existing notebook to run a Word2Vec model. I went through the tutorial and decided to focus on the Word2Vec part of the tutorial. I played around with the number of epochs that the model runs for. It was originally 3, and I decided to run 20 which took a long time. It didn't seem to improve the model much, so I went back to having 7 epochs. However, it seems like there wasn't any improvement, and running only 1 epoch was better.

**Day 9:** I worked on the Kaggle Document with the MNIST dataset and made some edits so that it would run.

**Day 10:**
How do you think Machine Learning or AI concepts were utilized in the design of this game?
The game shows that machine learning models are biased based on the data that it is trained on, even if it is unintentional. 
Can you give a real-world example of a biased machine learning model, and share your ideas on how you make this model more fair, inclusive, and equitable? Please reflect on why you selected this specific biased model.
I’ve heard that police sometimes use machine learning models to determine the probability that a person will commit a crime. This is biased mostly because of skin color, but also other factors such as neighborhood. I actually don’t think this is a good idea because every individual is different, and a machine learning model should not be used to evaluate a person. However, an idea to make this model more fair, inclusive, and equitable is to not use facial, skin color, and address information, and to only use information based on previous actions or crimes.

**Day 11**
Succinctly list the differences between a Convolutional Neural Network and a
Fully Connected Neural Network. Discuss layers and their role, and
applications of each of the two types of architectures.

Convolutional Neural Network: A convolutional neural network is more specialized and efficient. Only some of the nearby neurons are made and the same set of weights is used for every neuron. It's typically used for image data with local features. Compared to fully connected neural networks, it uses less memory and computations.

Fully Connected Neural Network: In a fully connected neural network, each neuron has a weight and is connected to all neurons in the previous layer. It takes up a lot of memory and computational time, but because it is fully connected, no assumptions about the features of the data are made. It is also used for images, when convolutional neural networks do not work well.

**Day 14**
I worked on a tutorial to predict house prices using a CNN.

**Day 15**
A rectified linear activation function is that while it is not linear, it is simple and provides the same benefits as Sigmoid but with better performance. It is between 0 and 1 and differentiable. One use case is to map predicted values to probabilities.
